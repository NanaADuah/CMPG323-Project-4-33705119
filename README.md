# Introduction
Testing is a critical part of the software development process, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a pivotal step that determines whether a solution is ready for production deployment. This automation project focuses on using RPA to expedite the UAT process for the EcoPower Logistics web application.

# Requirements
## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements are the core functionalities that the RPA solution should have:

Data Input: The automation must be able to input data records from the provided Excel file into the web application's fields.

Validation: The solution should validate that the desired output matches the expected results after data input.

Logging: Implement a logging mechanism to record the test results and any errors encountered during the testing process.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements are essential to ensure that the RPA solution meets quality standards:

Reliability: The automation should be reliable, accurately performing tests without errors.

Efficiency: The RPA solution should complete UAT in a timely and efficient manner, saving time and effort.

Scalability: Ensure that the automation is easily adaptable to handle additional test cases or changes in the web application.

Robustness: The solution should handle unexpected errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
